## The Weekly Team Meeting  

<img src="/Images/jedi.png" width="500">    

Every Wednesday @ 11:00-12:00, the NYU mHealth Team (interns and staff) gather in Room 718 (and on [appear.in/nyumhealth](https://appear.in/nyumhealth)) to brainstorm, collaborate, and learn.   

These are early days, and we are still working out what we all want this to look like (that means you!).
