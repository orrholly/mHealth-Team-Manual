### Agile: This is How We Roll

    agÂ·ile: adjective 
    
        1. able to move quickly and easily. 
        "Ruth was as agile as a monkey."  
        synonyms: nimble, lithe, supple, limber, acrobatic, fleet-footed, light-footed, light on one's feet  
        
        2. relating to or denoting a method of project management, used especially for software development,  
        that is characterized by the division of tasks into short phases of work and frequent reassessment   
        and adaptation of plans.
        "agile methods replace high-level design with frequent redesign"  

Once upon a time, we thought we could plan ahead for everything (LOL). But then [Moore's Law] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) got in the way. For years we fell down a [waterfall](Agile.vs.Waterfall.pdf) (punn intended). The weird thing is - we followed a plan that was really meant to be a warning (really you got to read [*this*](Agile.vs.Waterfall.pdf) - it's insane). As a result, a bunch of brilliant (and frusturated) developers came together to create a framework that could best answer the riddle "how do you manage a team in a world of constant change?". The answer: [The Agile Manifesto] (http://www.agilemanifesto.org/principles.html). We know, the "official web page" looks like your mom's blog post - but be nice... with age, comes wisdom (and content > presentation).

OK. Good point (says you - after you read [**what we told you to read above**)](Agile.vs.Waterfall.pdf). 

#### Scrum

        "But how do I implement an Agile approach to my work?"

Well... there are frameworks for Agile that help you set some rules and steps for humans to follow. The idea with Agile is that you can choose rules... and then break them to fit your needs (we call it "peaceful anarchy" ). Currently, we are in the  [Scrum](https://www.scrumalliance.org/why-scrum) tribe, but there are many other choices: (Kanban, Extreme Programming, Adaptive Software Development...). BTW - Tell us why would we should pivot to another... we are alway opens to change (Agile). But for now...

        Scrum is an Agile framework for completing complex projects. Scrum originally was formalized for  
        software development projects, but it works well for any complex, innovative scope of work.   
        The possibilities are endless. The Scrum framework is deceptively simple.

What?? That makes it clear as mud. Yea, we know. Welcome to the world of tech documentation. So, let's break it down to the parts of Scrum we currently practice at NYU mHealth:
- [Sprint](The Weekly Sprint Meeting.md): Currently, our sprints last one week (Tuesday to Tuesday). A Sprint ideally is the tasks Tom (product owner) has identified as a priority to get a accomplished during that week. Of course things change and come up - but we try to focus on this list during the Sprint.  
- [The Weekly Sprint Planning Meeting](The Weekly Sprint Meeting.md): This is where the staff plans the next week's Sprint.
- [Scrum Board](https://confluence.atlassian.com/agile/jira-agile-user-s-guide/using-a-board): This is a tool we use in Jira to see what we are working on in the current Sprint. The sprint tasks are organized in three sections: To Do, In Progress, Done.  
- [Backlog](https://confluence.atlassian.com/agile/jira-agile-user-s-guide/using-a-board/using-the-backlog): Tasks we have identified that are not part of the current Sprint. Think of it as our TODO list for later!  

As we grow and learn as a team, we will add more Scrum/Agile elements to our process - hey we're learning all this too! If you want to learn more about Agile and Scrum, here are a list of resources we suggest (remember to feel free to add any you find)!  
- [Scrum: a Breathtakingly Brief and Agile Introduction](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/193796504X?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00) - A good place to start (it only takes a few minutes to read). And, we have this book in our library (so you can check it out).  
- [The Elements of Scrum](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0982866917?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00) - We have this book in our library (so you can check it out).

#### Jira

When you were onboarded, you were given an account for NYU mHealth Jira. This is the tool we use for our Scrum processes. There are many, many tools out there - but so far we like this one. There is alot to it, but for our purposes you only learn how to do 3 things:
  
  - Login to [the NYU mHealth Jira](https://nyumhealth.atlassian.net) site.
  - [Create a Project](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jiracloud/create-a-project-735940417.html)
  - Create an [issue](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwarecloud/creating-issues-and-sub-tasks-764478439.html) for simplicity we are only using "Task" issue types currently.
  - Add a Task to the [backlog](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwarecloud/using-the-backlog-764478062.html) or current sprint.
  - If the task is in the sprint, drag the task from Todo to In Progress to Done in the Scrum board.

  That's it! Ask us questions if you need help - it may take a few tries to get the hang of it. Of course you can [learn more](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwarecloud/jira-software-documentation-764477791.html) if you want to...
