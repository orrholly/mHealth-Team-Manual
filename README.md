#### Welcome

We are excited to have you as part of the NYU mHealth Team! First off, take a minute to add your info to this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oxFE-A4XSGE57QjfEF16QaH1KA5AGuzfP-C-u4MOGOI/edit#gid=0). 

If we haven't done this already, you should schedule time with holly.orr@nyu.edu or sasha.guttentag@nyu.edu so we can give you a brief introduction to the tools we use and verify you have access. After that, you can use this manual to learn more about the team, systems, and tools we use for effective collaboration. Have fun!

#### Starting with Github

Congratulations! Since you are reading this, you have accomplised the first step in your onboarding process... accessing our Github site! You are inside what is called a repository (repo for short). Each repo on the NYU mHealth site is associated with a research project or topic where files, code, and documentation can be updated and managed. Git is the current cool kid for [version control](http://git-scm.com/video/what-is-version-control). But more on that later...

#### Create Your Avatar

The next step to becoming an NYU mHealth team member is creating your avatar! Yes, we know it's whimsical, but believe us, it serves a purpose. You'll see. For now, download one of the following apps (or add your favorite to the list!), create your avatar, and send it as a .png or .jpg to holly.orr@nyu.edu or sasha.guttentag@nyu.edu.

#### Send Us Your Bio

As we create the website, we'd like to include mini-bios about all of our members - along with the avatars (see above). Here's an example bio just so you have a sense of what we're going for:

*Jane Doe is an Epidemiology MPH student at the NYU College of Global Public Health. Her interests include geospatial analysis and predictive behavior modeling. Within the mHealth Lab, she is currently focused on QA testing of mobile surveying software and cross-collaborative project management.*

#### The Culture

We are a team that thrives on collaboration. We honor our unique backgrounds, expertise, and insights. There are no "dumb" questions or answers. No one is born knowing how to use Jira, build a log-linear model, program in Python, or develop the best research protocol. That's why we are here, right? To learn! 

We like to say if you meet someone that is born knowing how to do *everything* then [they are probably some sort of AI from the future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terminator) and you should run-away as fast as possible! 

So ask questions! Fail fast and often! And teach your teammates when you can!

In the spirit of collaboration and innovation, we have borrowed a project management method/framework that started in Silicon Valley, but has also become popular in organizations outside the tech sector: Agile/Scrum.  It's how we run meetings and organize our team. You will learn by osmosis (don't sweat it)! But, if you would like to learn more (by reading)...[ go here](Agile, Scrum (and Jira).md).

#### The Need to Know

**Calendars and Schedules**    

When you're not going to be in the office. Rather your sick, travelling, overwhelmed with midterms, broke up with your boyfriend/girlfrind/both/yourself - just please tell us you are can't come in through Slack or email (no judgement).    

We currently have three Google calendars we can share with you. For help on how to use NYU Google Calendars look [here](https://www.nyu.edu/life/resources-and-services/information-technology/communication-and-conferencing/nyu-calendar.html).  
 * **mHealth Student Schedules:** Keep this calendar updated with the days and times you plan on being in the office.     
 - **mHealth Out of Office:** Keep this up to date with times you will be out of office.    
 - **mHealth Events:** Add events here that we host or would be of interest to the group.  
 - **mHealth Meetings:** Add all meetings here.  
 - **41 E. 11th St. Room Reservation:** To book rooms for meetings at CGPH request access from koylan.gomez@nyu.edu.  
 
**Travel and Reimbursements**  
This is Koylan Gomez, Faculty Admin Extraordinaire - koylan.gomez@nyu.edu  <img src="/Images/koylan.JPG" width="35">  

Koylan supports 9 faculty at CGPH (phew!). So when we need her, we want to be as helpful as possible. If you are making travel plans and need to purchase transportation and/or accomodations, please try to make the request at least a week in advance. If you find yourself needing to make last minute changes or plans, please talk to Tom.

Koylan can also help with reimbursements on travel expenses and other purchases related to NYU mHealth. These will require you provide receipts!

**Meetings, Video Conferencing, and Phone Conference Line**  

We have two weekly meetings in Room 718:
- [The Weekly Sprint Meeting](Weekly_Sprint.md) (staff meeting - student's attendance optional): Tuesdays - 10:30-11:00  
- [The Weekly Team Meeting](Team.md) (try to be at this one!): Wednesdays - 11:00-12:00  

When you can't meet face-to-face, you can come virtually by going here: [https://appear.in/nyumhealth](https://appear.in/nyumhealth).

CGPH does have a conference line. It can be reserved if you have access to the 41 E. 11th St Room Reservation Calendar. Otherwise, check with Koylan.
