### The Sprint  

Every Tuesday @ 10:30-11:00, the NYU mHealth gathers in Room 718 (and on appear.in/nyumhealth) to plan the next week's priorities (aka Sprint in Scrum world). This is one of the elements of Agile/Scrum that the team has adopted. To learn more about that go to the [Agile, Scrum (and Jira)](Agile.md) page in this manual. 

We keep these meetings short and sweet (30 minutes). Here's how it is structured:

1. The Product Owner (Tom) describes the highest ordered product backlog item(s). 
2. The team determines and prioritizes what is necessary to complete that product backlog item(s). 
3. Team members volunteer to own the work.   
4. Work owners estimate the ideal hours they need to finish their work.   
5. Planning continues while the team does not exceed determined capacity.
