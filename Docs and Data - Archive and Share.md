####Where Do I Put This?
We are still working out the kinks on this one (it's hard people). With your help, we will come up with the best solution for our work, research, and team. It's an iterative process, but here's a first go:

####<img src="/Images/Google-Drive-Icon.ico" width="70">  NYU mHealth Google Drive
NYU is a Google Apps for Ed instution. This means students, staff, and faculty are all in the Google ecosystem (Gmail, Drive, Hangouts, Groups, etc).

What goes here:

    - Project documents  
    - Papers  
    - IRB materials  
    - Research  
    - Meeting notes
    
Why does it go here:

    - Faculty, staff, and students understand how it works (it's intuitive)
    - Easy to share with internal and external collaborators
    - It's basically Excel and Word for the cloud - but free

####<img src="/Images/Box-logo.jpg" width="70">  NYU Box  
[NYU Box](https://www.nyu.edu/life/resources-and-services/information-technology/websites-storage-and-sharing/nyu-box.html) is available to NYU and faculty and staff. Students can get access if faculty or staff make a request to askit@nyu.edu. If you need to store or share sensitive data (IRB, PII, HIPAA) asking Holly, Hong, Tom, or Tac to email a request to askit@nyu.edu. 
Data that is under IRB - Non-Anonymous human subject data

What goes here:

    - PII (personally identifiable data)
    - FERPA (student records)  
    - Intellectual property (data we buy or might sell)
    - Sensitive data (if you have to ask, put it in the Box)
    
Why does it go here:

    - Box is the NYU-approved storage of restricted data
    - NYU IRB has given Box the stamp of approval

####<img src="/Images/Octocat.png" width="70">  NYU mHealth Github
We have a whole section on how to use Github [here](Github, Git Desktop, and Git.md).

What goes here:

    - Code  
    - Documentation that gets updated often (like this manaual!)  
    
Why does it go here:

    - Version control (for an explanation look here)
    - Easy to access for the team
    - You can put that you have used Github on your resume
