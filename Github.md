### Version Control and Git

In case you don't know what version control is and why we use it, [watch this](http://git-scm.com/video/what-is-version-control) and then come back.

There are [many choices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_version_control_software) in the version control market. At NYU mHealth, we use Git. 

If you already have a Github account, give Holly or Sasha your username so we can add you to the NYU mHealth Github organization. 

If you don't have an account:

    - Go to [Github.com](https://github.com/)  
    - Sign up for an account    
    - Give Holly or Sasha your username  

Once you have access, you might want to bookmark our Github instance: https://github.com/nyu-mhealth

#### What's the Diff?
Now you are saying, what's the difference between Git, Git Desktop, and Github? 

**[GitHub](https://github.com/)** is a hosting service for Git repositories. It allows for easy team collaboration - a central place for us to share our code and often changing documentation (like this Team Handbook)! You can get by just using Github to upload, view, and download files. But if you are going to do some programming you probably want to try... 

**[Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)** is a desktop client that allows you to do most functions you can do with Git. You can stop here (really). But if you want to go deeper (and impress your friends), learn...   

**[Git](https://git-scm.com/)** is the actual version control system, and a command line tool to manage your source code history.   

So, they are not the same thing: 

- GitHub = a web service for projects that use Git
- Github Desktop = a GUI (graphical user interface) desktop client that makes using git commands easier
- Git = the tool and the command line approach to executing Git commands

Git it (haha)? Still confused? Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKVlZ3wFVKA) or ask us!

#### Gitting Started (It's a great pun)

While we are onboarding you, we will help you create a repo for your research and/or project. You can also ask your teammates for help. Or you can checkout some tutorials, like the ones we've listed below (there are a ton out there). If you find others you recommend - add it to this list!

- [Github Use Cases and Desktop Apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l40x1EshOBE)
- [Getting Git Right](https://www.atlassian.com/git/)
- [Tutorial on Branching - (advanced users)](http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/)

#### Markdown (.md)
This team manual was created with markdown. It looks weird at first, but you will get the hang of it pretty fast. Also, it's a good idea whenever you create a repo, to create a README.md file and use markdown to write and explanation of the purpose of the repo. Here's [a great guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to get you going.
