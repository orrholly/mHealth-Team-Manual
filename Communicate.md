**Slack**  
By now you should have been added to the NYU mHealth Slack account and been shown how to use it during your onboarding. If you haven't - tell us!

The mHealth Team uses Slack for quick questions and discussions. These are conducted through "channels". To learn how can see all the channels that have been created by members look [here](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201925108-Understanding-channels-and-DMs). You can ask to be invited to a channel or invite other members to a channel you are a member. There are a lot of ways to use Slack, too many to go over here. Here are some links to tutorials that can help (remember add any links you found helpful!).

**Google Groups / Email**  

During your onboarding, you were added to our mhealth Google Group. This serves as a dlist and central team email account that can be used for assigning permissions to the entire team on all other Google Apps for Ed products (Drive, Calendar, etc).

There are alot of video conferencing solutions out there. Some are better than others. Here is what we currently use (again - if you have a suggestion tell us or add it here!):  
 - https://appear.in/nyumhealth - This is where we hold our weekly meetings for those who are remote or can't attend in person. We've found it is more reliable than Google Hangouts (at least for now). Just put that link in your browser during the appointed meeting time and you should see us!
 - [Google Hangouts](https://www.nyu.edu/life/resources-and-services/information-technology/communication-and-conferencing/meetings-chat-conferencing/nyu-chat-and-hangouts.html) - This is a supported NYU Google app. We tend to use this when our meetings involve screen sharing - it's a bit better for that than appear.in.

<img src="/Images/people.png" width="45">  **Face-to-Face**  
Nothing beats face-to-face commuminication. Alot can be lost when we aren't in the same room. So, when you can, come to our team meetings!
